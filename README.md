# Notes

Thanks for the oppurtunity!

Tech Used:

- Created App using create React app with type script configuration.

- Tailwind for quick and responsive development with a lot of options, it may become quite complex while developing a style rich components but I still feel it's better than usuing conventional or external css. (Also it's the one I am familiar with so :P)

- Implemented a combination of Grid and Flex Model here. Still a far away at being good at it but learning a bit more everyday.

- Decided to go with static data due to time constraints, we can also create a hook to fetch data from an API to display and store in state variables.

- Used SVG icons for the icons and tried to make it as pixel perfect I could, can be improved a lot though.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
